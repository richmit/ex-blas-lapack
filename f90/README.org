* ~BLAS~ & ~LAPACK~ examples in ~Modern Fortran~

I've included modules to help interface with ~BLAS~ & ~LAPACK~:
 - ~blas_kinds~ ::
   Constants for ~single~ && ~double~ reals
 - ~blas_ifaces~ :: 
   Interface block for the ~BLAS~ routines used
 - ~lapack_ifaces~ :: 
   Interface block for the ~LAPACK~ routines used

Modern Fortran ~BLAS~ & ~LAPACK~ Tips:
 - Always use explicit kind suffixes for real kinds for constants. i.e. ~0.1_dp~
 - Always use a proper interface for every routine.
 - Make use of ~RESHAPE~ & ~ORDER~ to initialize matrices in a natural
   way for your application.
 - Avoid old-school tricks like passing scalars, sometimes of different
   types, to array arguments you know won't be used.  Just keep
   everything clean, easy to read, and type-safe.

Have fun!
