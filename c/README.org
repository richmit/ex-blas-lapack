* ~BLAS~ & ~LAPACK~ examples in ~C~

The ~BLAS~ programs illustrate ~CBLAS~ -- a venerable interface to
~BLAS~ for ~C~-family languages.

The ~LAPACK~ program demonstrates ~LAPACKE~ -- the official ~C~-family
language interface to LAPACK.

Older ~C~ code may use the older ~CLAPACK~ interface.  ~LAPACKE~
provides backward compatibility with this interface, and ~slvSys.c~
has commented out lines demonstrating the older calling method.

Have fun!
